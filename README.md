# ML-Bank-Marketing
For this exercise we are going to use the Bank Marketing dataset from Moro et al. , which tries to 1
predict if a marketing initiative of a banking institution will results in the clients subscribing into a
service.
The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/
Bank+Marketing), with the bank.csv file being the one that we are going to use.
This dataset consists on 15 features (all of them explained in detail in the dataset), and one binary
output variable ('y') which indicates if the consumer has subscribed or not to the service. Beware
that not all the features are encoded as numeric values, and the target feature is also encoded as
a categorical variable.
